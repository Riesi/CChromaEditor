# Empty CChromaEditor

The drop in solution for when the game you are trying to play fails spectacular with `CChromaLibraryEditor.dll`.
The dll is almost empty with only direct return calls. With that you don't have to bother about wrong loading Chroma functionality since there is none.

## Code

Not everything I modified was necessary, but it works for me in Doom 2016 so I will leave it as is until someone files a valid issue.
